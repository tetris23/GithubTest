About Project:-

•	Restaurant Management System – Self Service:

A restaurant management system is a collective term for software that helps streamline food business operations. Namely restaurants, bakeries, cafes, cloud kitchens or delivery businesses.

It combines all basic features that a customer has to go through while placing an order with tools that manage your orders, handle billings etc. It also works seamlessly with your existing restaurant technology systems.

•	Advantages / Benefits:

1.	Reduce the order processing time.
2.	Automate redundant work.
3.	Deliver a great customer experience.
4.	Determine Profit & Costs.

•	Ordering Process:
Customers will be provided an iPad with an in-built software system in form of an app from which they have to place an order of their desired cuisines. The whole procedure is customer-driven.
After placing the order our Restaurant Management System (RMS) will accept the responses and within the stipulated time the cuisines will be directly served to the customers with their respective invoices.
